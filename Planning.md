🧠 Build Your Own AI Assistant From Scratch (No Third-Party Models, Self-Trained)
📅 Phase 1 – Learn the Fundamentals
Objective
Understand the basics of deep learning, NLP, and language models.

Tasks
Study neural networks, transformers, attention mechanisms

Get comfortable with PyTorch or TensorFlow

Understand tokenization and BPE/WordPiece algorithms

Read papers: "Attention is All You Need", GPT family papers

📅 Phase 2 – Set Up Your Training Environment
Objective
Prepare hardware and software to train language models.

Tasks
Get access to a GPU (local high-end GPU or cloud like Lambda Labs/RunPod)

Install Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, CUDA drivers

Set up data pipeline for loading and preprocessing datasets

Install necessary libraries for NLP (e.g. tokenizers, transformers)

📅 Phase 3 – Collect & Prepare Training Data
Objective
Gather a large-scale text dataset to train your language model.

Tasks
Download open datasets like OpenWebText, Wikipedia dumps, or build your own corpus

Clean, filter, and tokenize data

Implement a tokenizer (BPE or WordPiece) or use open-source tokenizer code (but not pretrained models)

Create efficient data loaders

📅 Phase 4 – Implement Your Own Transformer Model
Objective
Code the transformer architecture from scratch.

Tasks
Implement multi-head self-attention, positional encoding

Build encoder/decoder stacks (for GPT-style: decoder only)

Add layer normalization, residual connections

Implement masked language modeling or causal language modeling training objective

Verify model forward pass and training loop

📅 Phase 5 – Train a Small Language Model (Proof of Concept)
Objective
Train a small GPT-like model on a small dataset.

Tasks
Train a model with ~10M to 100M parameters

Use a small dataset (like WikiText-2 or OpenWebText subset)

Monitor loss, tune hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size)

Save checkpoints, test text generation

📅 Phase 6 – Scale Up Training & Data
Objective
Train larger models with more data.

Tasks
Optimize training for speed and memory (mixed precision, gradient checkpointing)

Expand dataset size to billions of tokens

Implement distributed training if you have multiple GPUs

Regularly evaluate and sample from the model

📅 Phase 7 – Build Your AI Assistant Application
Objective
Wrap your trained model in an interactive assistant app.

Tasks
Implement prompt handling and input/output processing

Create conversation history and context window management

Build a user interface (CLI, desktop app, or web UI)

Optimize inference speed and model loading

📅 Phase 8 – Add Advanced Features
Objective
Improve your assistant’s usability.

Tasks
Add memory with embeddings and retrieval

Implement personality and system prompts

Integrate tools or external knowledge bases

Add voice input/output or other modalities

⚠️ Real Talk: What You’re Up Against
Training a GPT-level model from scratch requires huge compute resources (multiple high-end GPUs or cloud clusters).

Dataset curation and cleaning is a massive job.

Optimizing transformer training and inference is complex and research-grade work.

You will be learning tons of ML fundamentals along the way — no shortcuts here.

🔥 Final Advice
Start super small: train tiny transformers on toy data first.

Use open-source transformer implementations (e.g. from Hugging Face) as references but write your own code.

Consider contributing to or studying open projects like GPT-NeoX, GPT-J, or EleutherAI for inspiration.
