# 🧠 AI Assistant From Scratch

## Quick Start Guide

Welcome to your AI Assistant development workspace! This project will guide you through building a complete AI assistant from the ground up.

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Start the Interactive Guide**
   ```bash
   python start_ai_assistant.py
   ```

3. **Begin with Phase 1: Fundamentals**
   - Open the Jupyter notebook: `phase1_fundamentals/01_pytorch_basics.ipynb`
   - Work through PyTorch basics, attention mechanisms, and transformers
   - Run the Python examples to test your understanding

### 🚨 Important Notes

- **No Shortcuts**: Everything is built from scratch for deep learning
- **GPU Recommended**: Training will be slow on CPU-only systems
- **Patience Required**: Building AI from scratch takes time and effort
- **Learning Focused**: Understanding is more important than speed
